# Emaily

Web App to send surveys to a list of recipients and collect the answers. Made with React, Redux, Node.js and MongoDB.

The file containing the identifiers of the database and the private keys for Google OAuth, Stripe (the payment API), and Sendgrid (the platform to manage the emails), is not present in the repository. For this reason, it is not possible to run the project locally.

Some of the features have been made with the help of the Udemy course "Node with React: Fullstack Web Development"
